        synopsis: "The very first big-screen adaptation of Spider-Man. There had been made-for-TV movies and television shows based on the Marvel comic series, but Spidey did not make his theatrical debut until 2002. Directed by Sam Raimi, this version starred Tobey Maguire as awkward high school student Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, his love interest. The film documents Peter’s evolution into becoming Spider-Man, from that initial bite in the laboratory to his battle against the Green Goblin.",
